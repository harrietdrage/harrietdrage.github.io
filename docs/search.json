I am an advocate of open-access publishing and data, and enjoy dabbling in web design.\nI am dedicated to improving publishing, conditions in academia, and inclusivity. I am Co-Founder and Managing Editor of Open Palaeontology (ISSN:), and Newsletter Editor and Charity Trustee for The Palaeontological Association.\nI worked previously as a Commissioning Editor for science in secondary education (age 11–18) for Oxford University Press.
