<h2>Value-driven leader, open science advocate, fan of fossils.</h2>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Lausanne, working on the palaeobiology and palaeoecology of arthropods in deep time. To do so, I employ sophisticated computational analytical methods, statistics, and fluid dynamics techniques, using big data. I am an advocate of open-access publishing and data, and enjoy dabbling in web design.

I am dedicated to improving publishing, conditions in academia, and inclusivity. I am Co-Founder and Managing Editor of <i>Open Palaeontology</i> (ISSN:), and Newsletter Editor and Charity Trustee for <i>The Palaeontological Association</i>.

I worked previously as a Commissioning Editor for science in secondary education (age 11--18) for Oxford University Press. In my spare time, I enjoy climbing, hiking, weightlifting, video games, and sewing.
